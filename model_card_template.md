For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details
The model selected for this project is a Logistic Regression Model.

## Intended Use
The intended use of the data is to learn how to use FASTAPI via the Udacity Machine Learning DevOps course.

## Training Data
The Training data was given to me by Udacity, titled census.csv. 

## Evaluation Data
A subset of the training dataset was used for validation purposes. It was checked to make sure it was similar in structure to the full dataset.

## Metrics
The metrics the model used were Recall, F1 score, and precision.

## Ethical Considerations
The data came from the UC Irvines machine learning repository. They make sure their data is stripped of all personal information and that it can be used ethically before publishing it tot the public.

## Caveats and Recommendations
The model was created for learning purposes and may not assimilate well to new or real-world data. It is not intended to go further than this educational project. It will never and should never go into production.
